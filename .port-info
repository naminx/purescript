# Active Ports

## Application Server
- **Port 8080**: Node.js server (serve.js)
  - Status: ACTIVE
  - URL: https://8080--019a570f-232a-7050-a61e-ccef022a8b32.us-east-1-01.gitpod.dev
  - Process: node serve.js

## Inactive Preview Ports (can be ignored)
- Port 8000: No process (stale preview registration)
- Port 8001: No process (stale preview registration)
- Port 8003: No process (stale preview registration)
- Port 8004: No process (stale preview registration)

These inactive ports are leftover from earlier server startup attempts.
They don't consume resources and will be cleaned up by Gitpod automatically.

## To Start the Server
```bash
cd /workspaces/purescript
node serve.js
```

Or use the preview command:
```bash
exec_preview "node /workspaces/purescript/serve.js" 8080
```
